## Point of current development

## History of development

Development of this project dates back to 2019, and was developed under various umbrellas over time:

### Cappuccino (Fist/Ando/Ellie42) - "The Erupe Developers" (2019-2020)

<https://github.com/Ellie42/Erupe> / <https://github.com/ricochhet/Erupe-Legacy>

**Initial proof-of-concept** and foundational work:

* Basic server infrastructure (Sign, Entrance, Channel servers)
* Account registration and character creation systems
* Initial multiplayer lobby functionality
* Core network communication layer
* Save data compression using delta/diff encoding
* Stage management and reservation systems for multiplayer quests
* Party system supporting up to 4 players
* Chat system (local, party, private messaging)
* Hunter Navi NPC interactions
* Diva Defense feature
* Quest selection and basic quest support
* PostgreSQL database integration with migration support

**Technical Details:**

* Repository created: March 6, 2020
* Public commits: March 4-12, 2020 (9 days of visible development)
* Total commits: 142
* Status: Still active closed source

The original developers created this as an educational project to learn server emulation. This version established the fundamental architecture that all subsequent versions built upon.

### Einherjar Team (~2020-2022 Feb)

**Major expansion period** (estimated March 2020 - February 2022):

Unfortunately, **no public git history exists** for this critical development period. The Einherjar Team's work was used as the foundation for all subsequent community repositories. Based on features present in the Community Edition fork (February 2022) that weren't in the original Cappuccino version, the Einherjar Team likely implemented:

* Extensive quest system improvements
* Guild system foundations
* Economy and item distribution systems
* Additional game mechanics and features
* Stability improvements and bug fixes
* Database schema expansions

This ~2-year period represents the largest gap in documented history. If anyone has information about this team's contributions, please contact the project maintainers.
